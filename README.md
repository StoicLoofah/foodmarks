foodmarks
=========

foodmarks is a Django web application for storing recipes and recipe bookmarks. Compared to other recipe organizers, foodmarks was made with 3 specific concerns in mind:

* Improving tag search. Instead of generic tags, all recipe tags are grouped under categories, such as "ingredient" or "course"
* Integrating both bookmarks and original recipes into a single source. Rather than looking up a bookmarking tool for some recipes and Word documents (or physical binders) for others, foodmarks puts all of those in one place
* Sharing recipes with friends and family. All recipes (and bookmarks) are public, and you can add other users' recipes to your own collection.

This project is quite old so the patterns are quite outdated. I also wrote it relatively early in my coding career, so there are probably a lot of coding and conceptual errors in there as well.
