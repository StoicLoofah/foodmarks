foodmarks
=========

foodmarks is a Django web application for storing recipes and recipe bookmarks. Compared to other recipe organizers, foodmarks was made with 3 specific concerns in mind:

* Recipe tagging for easy search and retrieval
* Integrating both bookmarks and original recipes into a single place. Rather than looking up a bookmarking tool for some recipes and Word documents (or physical binders) for others, foodmarks puts all of those in one place
* Sharing recipes with friends and family. All recipes (and bookmarks) are public, and you can add other users' recipes to your own collection.

This side project is only sporadically maintained, so the code uses outdated patterns and reflects less mature code. Nevertheless, it has been stable and used continuously since 2011.
